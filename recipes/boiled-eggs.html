        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This method makes the most perfect hard-boiled eggs ever. The whites are firm
             but not rubbery, and the yolks are cooked and still creamy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place eggs into a saucepan and pour in cold water to cover; place over high
                 heat. When the water just starts to simmer, turn off heat, cover pan with
                  a lid, and let stand for 17 minutes. Don't peek.</li>
            <li>Pour out the hot water and pour cold water over eggs. Drain and refill
                 with cold water; let stand until eggs are cool, about 20 minutes. Peel
                  eggs under running water.</li>
        </ol>
