        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Triple Cheddar and Colby Jack bring lots of cheese flavor to this creamy
             mac & cheese with just a hint of heat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1,5 cups Triple Cheddar Natural Shreds </li>
            <li>1 cup colby jack natural shreds</li>
            <li>2 cups macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>0,25 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1 cup half & half</li>
            <li>cayenne paper to taste</li>
            <li>0,5 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 1 1/2-quart casserole
                 dish with non-stick cooking spray. Combine Cheddar and Colby Jack cheeses 
                 in a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to package directions;
                 drain well and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Blend in flour,
                 stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly. Gradually whisk in milk and 
                 half & half. Stir constantly, until mixture boils and thickens (about 2 to
                  3 minutes). Remove from heat and add cayenne and black peppers, and 2 
                  cups of the reserved cheese mixture; stir until cheese is melted and 
                  sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir cooked macaroni into the sauce and season to taste. Place in the 
                prepared casserole dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and dot with
                 additional butter, if desired. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until heated
                  through and lightly browned.</li>
        </ol>
